# Volumetric Surgical Target Reconstruction

A significant problem in planning of volumetrically prescribed localized medical treatments, such as irradiation of tumors and surgical resections , is the mathematical impossibility to determine the exact three dimensional shape and volume of a target object from its projected X-ray images. Reconstruction accuracy also varies with viewing angle, depending on the convexity and aspect ratios of the target object. In response to this problem, your task would be developing a robust and efficient technique for approximate volumetric reconstruction, which 
    (A) uses no prior information of the shape and volume of the target, 
    (B) does not require exact silhouettes, 
    (C) accepts arbitrary number of X-ray images, 
    (D) produces solid object and measure of its volume, 
    (E) provides confidence measure of the reconstruction and drawing of silhouettes, 
    (F) is robust, fast and easy to implement. 
The method is applicable for any X-ray guided volumetric treatment. Pilot applications will be planning of radiosurgery of arterioveneous malformations (AVMs) and breast cancer surgery planning on X-ray mammography images.
